## Linear Regression
Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by 
fitting a linear equation to observed data. One variable is considered to be an 
explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable. 
For example, a modeler might want to relate the weights of individuals to their heights 
using a linear regression model.


## Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a process of modeling the probability of a discrete 
outcome given an input variable. The most common logistic regression models a binary 
outcome; something that can take two values such as true/false, yes/no, and so on. 
Multinomial logistic regression can model scenarios where there are more than 
two possible discrete outcomes. Logistic regression is a useful analysis method 
for classification problems, where you are trying to determine if a new sample 
fits best into a category. As aspects of cyber security are classification problems, 
such as attack detection, logistic regression is a useful analytic technique.
